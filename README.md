I have built an angular application that can be described as a Mobile Photo Geotagging Application Using Capacitor and 3D Maps.

To get the same results on your local pc run these commands:
`npm install -g @ionic/cli cordova-res`
`npm install`
`npm install @capacitor/camera @capacitor/geolocation`
`npm install @capacitor/android` or `npm install @capacitor/ios` or both
`ng add @angular/fire`
`npm install cesium`
`npm install -D @angular-builders/custom-webpack`

To run the programm type: `ionic serve`
